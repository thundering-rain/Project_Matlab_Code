This program, which is designed with the intention of functioning as a vq speaker recognition program is intended to be used in MATLAB
In order to properly use this program please follow these instructions:

1) Download all Twelve and Zero training and test wav files included in this respository

2) upload said wav files to your file directory in MATLAB by dragging and dropping

3) upload the Matlab_Code program to an appropriately named file in MATLAB

4) If you wish to test the accuracy of vq voice recognition for the twelve files, navigate to
line 3, which will have the code "file = sprintf('Zero_train%d.wav', p);", and replace the text "Zero" with "Twelve"

5) next navigate to line 71, which will have the code: "file1 = sprintf('Zero_test%d.wav', ii );" and again replace the text: "Zero"
with "Twelve"

6) if you wish to test the accuracy of vq voice recognition for the Zero files simply run the program

7) this program is, as it stands, optimized for use with the accompanying wav files, but if you wish to use alternate wav files:
navigate to line 2, which has the code: "for p = 1:18 " and change the "18" to the number of training and testing files you plan on using

8) now navigate to line 70, which has the code: "for ii =1:18" and again change the "18" to the number of training and testing vectors you 
plan on using

9) navigate to line 7, which has the code: "y = resample(y,2,17);" and, either increase, decrease or leave the sampling freuency,
making sure that in the next line, your Fs matches your resampled data

10) repeat step 8 for lines 73 and 74
