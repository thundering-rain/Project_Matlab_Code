This program, which is designed with the intention of functioning as a vq speaker recognition program is intended to be used in MATLAB
In order to properly use this program please follow these instructions:

1) Download all Twelve and Zero training and test wav files included in this respository

2) upload said wav files to your file directory in MATLAB by dragging and dropping

3) upload the Matlab_Code program to an appropriately named file in MATLAB

4) If you wish to test the accuracy of vq voice recognition for the twelve files, navigate to
line 2, which will have the code "file = sprintf('Zero_train%d.wav', p);", and replace the text "Zero" with "Twelve"

5) next navigate to line 12, which will have the code: "file1 = sprintf('Zero_test%d.wav', ii );" and again replace the text: "Zero"
with "Twelve", now run the program. The resuslts will be displayed in the command window.

6) if you wish to test the accuracy of vq voice recognition for the Zero files simply run the program
